Known issues
============

1. Importing the splparser module is very slow. This may be due to the large number of parse table modules.

2. Some of the command tests fail due to particularly difficult to parse cases.

3. There are many failures not captured by our test cases.

4. Parsers are not implemented for all Splunk commands, only the most-used ones.
