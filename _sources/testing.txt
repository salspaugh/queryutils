Running the tests
=================

Tests for splparser are written as `doctests <https://docs.python.org/2/library/doctest.html>`_ contained in the ``test`` directory.

The ``test`` directory structure mirrors the main code directory structure.

To execute all tests, run ``python run-tests.py``.
Note that this requires `nose <https://nose.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_.

There are currently known test failures representing difficult-to-parse and relatively uncommon situations.
